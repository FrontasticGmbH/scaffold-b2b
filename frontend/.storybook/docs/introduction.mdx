  # Getting started

  The Store Launchpad for B2B Manufacturing is a ready-to-use codebase that includes [frontend components](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-getting-started/development-concepts#components) that use JSON [schemas](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-development/schemas) and the [Composable Commerce](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-development/using-the-commercetools-extension) extension. The launchpad comes with pre-configured project settings and pages in the [Studio](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-studio/) that use B2B [sample data](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started/explore-b2b-sample-data).

  The store launchpad gives you a starting point and guidance for developing your commerce website, thus reducing your time-to-market and helping you offer a seamless and engaging shopping experience to your customers.

  The launchpad serves as a foundational template that you can customize, extend, or use as it is. Since every project is unique, you can use the full store launchpad or only some components, depending on your needs.

  For more detailed information see [Store Launchpad for B2B Manufacturing](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-development/b2b-store-launchpad-overview)
